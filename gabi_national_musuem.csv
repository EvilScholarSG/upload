After visting all the sections, we came across a penny pressed souvenir machine where you can choose to imprint the museum building or few other places of interest on the copper penny. The cost is $2 for each penny imprint. My wife scanned and pay with paywave but nothing happened. She scanned a second time but still its not working. We informed the security who seek help from the manager in charge. The manager later came and informed us the machine belongs to third party and they dont deal with third party. I was somehow intoxicated by his reply ""We dont deal with third party"". If you dont deal with third party, why you put the so called third party machine there? We were asked to scan the code and feedback to the relevant support dept via whatsapp. There is some spare penny already imprint inside the machine but they dont have the key to it. For this instance, if we are tourists coming to visit the museum, it will disgrace to the museum with this type service telling people you dont deal with third party and yet the machine is at your site.

Silly fact for those of you with kids who want to add some mystery...

SPOOKY SINGAPORE TRAIL FACT
The spiral staircase that leads up onto the roof of the museum isn?t open to visitors anymore, but even if it was, it is said that a mysterious force would stop you when you tried and would trip you up.

Some claim to have seen a priest-like figure or museum director on the stairs and so now these stairs are only cleaned twice a week!",5,National museum

Doraemon might not seem an obvious programming choice for a history museum, but director Chung May Khuen points out that the Japanese cartoon character is a beloved pop culture icon in Singapore.
Noting that the show has been dubbed into Malay and is still broadcast on television today, the self-confessed Doraemon fan says: ""Singaporeans have been watching Doraemon from the 1980s. It does play a part in our growing up years."" Besides a line of Doraemon figures marching across the museum's front lawn, fans of the cartoon character can snap Instagrammy selfies at booths scattered through the building. There will be, of course, an Anywhere Door for fans to imagine themselves transported to a destination of their choice. Devotees can also pick up limited edition merchandise designed by local lifestyle brand Supermama.

I feel very secured as well as there are many security guards to ensure the safety of everyone.

Everyone must go down and have a look at the stories behind how Singapore started and who contributed to where Singapore is now.

There's also bright animations that gives us a magical feeling with very cool music.

All I got to see was a few different Doraemon standing outside and 1 Doraemon with his time traveling machine and his sister.

On the other hand, there are exhibits of stuff of Singapore?s history that was much more interesting than Doraemon. I suspect Doraemon is just a bait to get people go check out on Singapore?s history, haha!",3,National museum
